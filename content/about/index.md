## A brief introduction
Hi! My name is Geoffrey Tuttle and I am an optical engineer from North Carolina. I received my Master's in Optical Science and Engineering at UNC Charlotte, and my Bachelor's in Physics at UNC Greensboro.

My main area of research is in 3D printing technology, which has given me a fair bit of exposure to optical, mechanical, and electrical engineering, as well as software experience in MATLAB, Python, and CNC programming.

I am currently working with a group developing flight simulators for fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft. My responsibilities include (but are not limited to):

* Installing, maintaining, and upgrading the multi-projector visual display systems for high-fidelity flight training.
* Developing and executing experiments to validate performance parameters of current and next-gen lab equipment
* Researching the applications of wave phenomena through laboratory experiments.

This has allowed me to sharpen my optical engineering knowledge, and develop new skills in computer networking, Arduino microcontroller programming, and C++ development. If you would like to talk more about my printing endeavors, research, or career goals, feel free to sent me an email at [geoffrey.tuttle@protonmail.com](mailto:geoffrey.tuttle@protonmail.com).

## About this site
This site is a collection of my personal projects, garage experiments, and hobby endeavors. Several of the posts on here were consolidated from old blogs and web pages into a more unified history of things I have developed or worked on. For a sampling of projects, please take a look at the [portfolio section](/tags/portfolio).
