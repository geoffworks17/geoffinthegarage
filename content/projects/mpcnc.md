The Mostly Printed CNC (MPCNC) is an entry level DIY kit for a small CNC milling machine developed by Ryan at [V1Engineering](https://www.v1engineering.com/). This well-documented project is supported by a huge community of tinkerers, hobbyists, and professional machinists who have contributed a multitude of add-ons to the machine.

This is a record of work performed and milestones reached on building my own MPCNC.
