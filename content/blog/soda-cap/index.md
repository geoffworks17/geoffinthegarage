A close friend works at a nearby bee farm, assembling and packing various products to ship out. This manufacturing involves a lot of dust floating around the production floor, and he asked if I could print something that would snap over his soda can to keep the stray particles out. I figured this was a perfect opportunity to practice some 3d CAD and get the printer going.

I intended the first version to simply rotate around the top of the can, protecting the hole from dust. The fit over the lip of the can was a bit tight, making rotation difficult. While this may have gotten the job done, I figured I could do better, so I moved on to Version 2.
